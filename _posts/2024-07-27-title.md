Activity: Create a blog post
Browse to the my-pages branch.
Click the Add file dropdown menu and then on Create new file.
Name the file _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md.
Replace the YYYY-MM-DD with today's date, and change the title of your first blog post if you'd like.
If you do edit the title, make sure there are hyphens between your words. If your blog post date doesn't follow the correct date convention, you'll receive an error and your site won't build. For more information, see "Page build failed: Invalid post date".

Type the following content at the top of your blog post:
#---
title: "YOUR-TITLE"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
#---
Replace YOUR-TITLE with the title for your blog post.
Replace YYYY-MM-DD with today's date.
Type a quick draft of your blog post. Remember, you can always edit it later.
Commit your changes to your branch.
Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). GitHub Actions will automatically update to the next step.
